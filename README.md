# meow
# Multiple C++ and Python utils
There are only availible two variants now - bark for removing and meow for reading from file
#How to install?
Do 'make' to build all supported modules and targets. Then 'make install' to install to /usr/bin and 'make uninstal'l to delete binaries from it.
#Troubleshooting
##Bark has compiled in non-standalone mode. 
It means that Bark cannot be run on systems with no Python installed. Do 'make target-py' to compile in standalone mode. No guarantees.

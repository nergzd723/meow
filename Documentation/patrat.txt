        Done!                    In progress

Do patrat init to init a patrat repo. It creates empty patmit with INIT message.

Patrat patmit is a targz package with random name. It is generated by genpatmitname().

Patrat patmit folder structure

patmit/
        xxxxx/
                xxxxx.pat
(x - patmit random name)

Full patrat folder structure

.patrat/
        PATT/
        patmit/
        patrat-git/
        patrat-git
        DLOG
        RATLOG
        PATLOG

DLOG contains info collected by patlogger - ratty function that logs almost all the stuff in the patrat.

PAT
PAT is a function that removes current tree, gets user-typed patmit and unzips it into tree. Used to fully recover a state of some patmit

Flow

Flow does the same as PAT does, but it doesnt remove current tree. So it just merge patmit with working tree

EM and HOTB
HOTB - special patmit, created on some changes, that may affect working tree. Just like F5 in games - quicksave. To recover it, just type patrat em. DO NOT PAT HOTB WITH EMPTY TREE!

Python modules description

aname
It uses Platform package which collects info about system. Use with -d flag to display all info it can possibly collect.
uname-like module.

bark
Bark utility removes files. Acts almost like rm, but there`re some difference. There`s not -f flag since it is not needed because bark do not ask delete file or not.
It recurses through argument list and removes everything it can see. If -r flag is used, it also deletes directories.

cpy
INTENDED to copy files. Do not properly work.

dip
Windows dir command alt. Displays all files in directory, each from newline.
Mechanism do not need to describe itself ^_^

dutils
Some fun and not only fun modules.

exo
Echoes some message to the shell or to the file
On Python, it opens the file if there is > in argument, and writes text to file

goblin
Performance test. Do not work, probably will be deprecated.

kid
That`s more interesting. It kills the process by pid or by name. Uses psutil library.
It just kills process with -9 signal or with SIGTERM if term specified in arguments.

meowshell
Opens sh shell which execs user commands. Not useful.

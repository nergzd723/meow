Build system of meowproj

It is Makefile-based build system. Each module has it`s own folder and in that folder there are some other Makefiles, which build a module.
The build/ folder is config for dpkg to build Debian packages.

Python modules are build using Nuitka. Nuitka assembles Python module to a binary file. Actually, Python modules still use system Python interpreter
because of binary size. Nuitka is used to not follow imports. Why do? Because build speed is quite big if follow imports to e.g. sys Python module
More about Python in the meow_pythonm.txt

C, C++ modules are build using Clang. Clang uses LLVM as a backend and code produced by it is usually faster than the code on GCC.
Go modules use gccgo. Go interpreter is too heavy and usually slower than gccgo.
